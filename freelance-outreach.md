# Freelance Outreach Guide for Anand Mohanan

## Target Client Segments

### 1. Startups Building AI Products
**Why them:** They're technical, move fast, and value expertise over cost
**Pain points:** 
- Building AI agents that actually work in production
- LLM cost optimization
- Integration challenges with existing systems
- Fast prototyping and iteration

### 2. Enterprises Automating Operations
**Why them:** Big budgets, need reliability
**Pain points:**
- Legacy systems that need AI integration
- Observability and monitoring needs
- Scalability concerns
- Security and compliance

### 3. Companies with Computer Vision Needs
**Why them:** Your YOLO/OpenCV/TFLite expertise is rare
**Pain points:**
- Quality control automation
- Surveillance and security
- Mobile AI integration
- Edge deployment

## Cold Email Templates

### Template 1: AI Startup (LangChain/LangGraph angle)

**Subject:** Quick question about your AI agent stack

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is building [specific product/feature from their website or recent news]. 

I'm a freelance AI engineer who specializes in production-ready LLM applications. Recently, I built an LLM observability SaaS from scratch using LangChain and LangGraph, helping a client reduce their API costs by 40% while improving output consistency.

I also have experience with:
- LangGraph multi-agent architectures
- RAG implementations with LlamaIndex
- Twilio/Vonage integrations for voice AI
- Production deployment on Kubernetes/Azure

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss how you might be handling [specific challenge they're likely facing]?

Best,
Anand

### Template 2: Enterprise (Observability angle)

**Subject:** Reducing LLM costs at [Company]?

Hi [Name],

I work with companies deploying AI at scale, and observability is often the missing piece.

Last quarter, I helped a Switzerland startup build a complete LLM observability platform— ClickHouse for analytics, Langfuse for tracing, custom dashboards in Grafana. The result: they cut LLM spend by 40% and could finally see where their agents were failing.

I'm currently taking on 1-2 clients for Q1 2026. If you're dealing with:
- Unpredictable LLM costs
- No visibility into agent behavior
- Scaling issues with current AI deployment

...I'd love to share what I've learned.

Would you be available for a quick call next week?

Best,
Anand

### Template 3: Computer Vision (Android/Edge angle)

**Subject:** YOLO integration for mobile?

Hi [Name],

I saw [Company]'s work with [specific application—surveillance, quality control, etc.]. 

I've built custom YOLO models for PPE compliance and drowsiness detection, integrated into Android apps using Java/Kotlin. Deployed on edge hardware for real-time inference with TFLite.

Also built face recognition systems for surveillance workflows and have experience with OpenCV for various vision tasks.

If you're exploring similar capabilities—or struggling with model performance on mobile—I'd be happy to share what I've learned.

Interested in a quick chat?

Best,
Anand

### Template 4: Video/Streaming (Kurento/M mediasoup angle)

**Subject:** Real-time video infrastructure?

Hi [Name],

I've built custom video conferencing platforms for healthcare and VR applications using:
- Kurento for WebRTC streaming
- Mediasoup for live VR streaming
- Java backend with RabbitMQ for messaging

Currently working with a Japan-based client on VR training dashboards with real-time video.

If you're building anything involving live video, I'd be happy to discuss architecture choices and lessons learned.

Best,
Anand
